This is a plugin for `pretalx`_, allowing attendees (or anybody interested) to vote on submitted proposals.

Development setup
-----------------

1. Make sure that you have a working `pretalx development setup`_.

2. Clone this repository, eg to ``local/pretalx-public-voting``.

3. Install the plugin in editable mode: ``uv pip install -e .``

4. Restart your local pretalx server. You can now use the plugin from this repository for your events by enabling it in
   the 'plugins' tab in the settings.


Development commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin uses `just`_ as a task runner and `uv`_ for dependency management.
Run ``just`` with no arguments to list every available command. The most useful ones
are:

``just fmt``
    Auto-format and lint the code.

``just test``
    Run the full test suite with pytest.

Installing pretalx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tests need pretalx installed in the environment. ``just test`` handles this for
you: if pretalx cannot be imported, it installs the latest version from git before
running the test suite.

If you already have a development version of pretalx around (for example if you want
to test your changes against a specific commit or branch of pretalx), you can also
install pretalx up front yourself:

``just install-pretalx-local /path/to/pretalx``
    Install pretalx from a local checkout as an editable install.

``just install-pretalx``
    Install the latest pretalx from git (runs before tests if no pretalx is installed).
